## Time Complexity: Understanding When It's 2^n vs n^n**

When analyzing recursive functions, the key is to look at how many recursive calls are made at each level:

1. **Constant branching** - calls itself the same number of times at every level
2. **Fixed branching** - calls itself a specific, unchanging number of times
3. **Decreasing branching** - calls itself fewer times as recursion progresses

## Example 1: O(n^n) - Constant Branching

```javascript
function func(depth) {
    if (depth >= maxDepth) return;
    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {
        func(depth + 1)  // Always n recursive calls
    }
}
```

*(Note: This is different from `func(i + 1)` which would create shrinking recursion)*

In this case, we make the same constant n number of recursive calls at every level, resulting in **O(n^n)** time complexity.

## Example 2: O(3^n) - Fixed Branching

```javascript
function func(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return;
    func(n - 1);  // Call 1
    func(n - 1);  // Call 2  
    func(n - 1);  // Call 3
}
```

This makes exactly 3 recursive calls at each level, resulting in **O(3^n)** complexity.

## Example 3: O(2^n) - Decreasing Branching

```javascript
function func(index) {
    for (let i = index + 1; i < n.length; i++) {
        func(i)  // Fewer calls as index increases
    }
}
```

This creates **O(2^n)** complexity because the branching factor decreases each time (n-1, n-2, n-3...). The "2" comes from solving the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + ..., which approximates exponential growth with base 2.

**Key takeaway:** Constant branching â†’ n^n, Decreasing branching â†’ 2^n (or similar small base)

# 1D Dynamic Programming Approaches

This guide outlines common techniques for solving one-dimensional dynamic programming problems, including standard DP, greedy strategies, and special greedy patterns like Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.

---

## Type 1: Standard DP â€“ Brute Force, Memoization, Bottom-Up

These problems typically involve overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

- **Brute Force**: Try all recursive paths.
- **Memoization (Top-Down DP)**: Use a cache (e.g. `Map` or array) to avoid recalculating subproblems.
- **Bottom-Up DP**: Create a `dp` array and fill it iteratively, usually from the base case up to the target.

### ðŸ”¹ Example â€“ Coin Change (Minimum Coins)
- **Brute Force**: Try all combinations to reach the target.
- **Memoization**: Cache results for each amount to prevent recomputation.
- **Bottom-Up**: Build `dp[amount]` from `0` to the target using the smallest number of coins.

---

## Type 2: Greedy + Binary Search

Greedy solutions differ from DP by making **locally optimal** decisions at each step without trying all options.

âœ… Use only if the problem satisfies the **greedy choice property** (local choices lead to global optimum).

### ðŸ”¹ Example â€“ Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- **Brute Force**: Try all subsequences â€“ `O(2^N)`.
- **Memoization**: Cache longest subsequence length per index â€“ `O(N^2)`.
- **Greedy + Binary Search**:
    - Maintain an array (`tails`) representing the smallest possible tail of an increasing subsequence of each length.
    - Use binary search to replace or append.
    - Time complexity: `O(N log N)`.

---

## Type 2B: Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm (Greedy for Subarrays)

Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is a greedy technique specifically for maximum subarray problems.

- Track `currentSum`: max subarray sum ending at current index.
- Track `globalMax`: max of all `currentSum` values so far.
- Decide at each step whether to extend the current subarray or start fresh.

### ðŸ”¹ Example â€“ Maximum Subarray Sum
- Handles negative numbers by resetting the subarray when `currentSum` drops below zero.
- Runs in linear time: `O(N)`.
